	<h2>Welcome to a J.D.Salinger Fan Club</h2>

	<p>
		The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in
		the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the 
		finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and 
		destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. 
	</p>

		My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get 
		it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money 
		is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that niggah Winston or 
		anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? 
	</p>

		Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period 
		so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through 
		too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. 
	</p>

		Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a 
		little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in 
		it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant 
		named Jeb.
